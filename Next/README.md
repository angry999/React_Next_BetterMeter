# BetterMeter-frontend-test

## Overview

Using mock data, reference the U/I elements provided in Figma and add basic react and material UI markup to the BetterMeter Main Dashboard.


## Requirements

* The code should be hosted on Github
* The code should be committed to a separate repo
* The app should be deployed and accessible using a URL
* The user should be able to filter analytics by Site
* The user should be able to view Site analytics by:
    * Date or string of dates
    * Events (page views, unique users, average time per visit, bounce rate)
    * Campaigns
* The user should be able to add multiple custom views, each one with its own date filter:
   * View 1 = Most Active Sites
   * View 2 = Most Visited Sites
   * View 3 = Top Events

## Guidelines

* Keep a log of your train of thought about key decisions, ideas, tradeoffs and submit it with the exercise
* In the same log, answer the following question:
  1. Which error handling strategy did you choose? Why?
* Treat the build as a productive one, we expect to see proper error handling, (some type of) testing and other good practices applied. That said, don't overengineer it, we will discuss possible improvements later

## Technologies (recommended for this test)

* React, Material U/I
